This is my final project for my high school coding class. 
To run this project, please refer to the README file in the repository. 
The project is a turn-based, map-based game where the objective is to 
control as much territory as possible by building an arsenal. Although 
the game is set in a fictional universe, it draws inspiration from the Yugoslav Wars.
